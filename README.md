# MITRE ATT&CK Defender (MAD) Cyber Threat Intelligence Certification

The MAD CTI certification is a part of the MITRE Engenuity (now MAD20) MITRE ATT&CK Defender training program. Users must pay an annual amount of $499 to access all of the certifications offered by MITRE (4 currently). You can just pay once, complete all of the certs in one year, and then pay again some years down the road when information is outdated or changed, which is my plan. Certs do not expire at a certain time, only when it is determined to be out of date by MITRE experts.

Unlike standard certifications, these certs are obtained by completing smaller assesssments, not one big test. As an added bonus, the training is available freely through Cybrary, so you only have to pay to acquire the certifications. You can take the training before you pay and decide for yourself if it is worth it or not to become officially certified. 

The CTI certification requires completion of the 4 assessment modules seen below:

Each module hit on different aspects of using MITRE ATT&CK for intelligence. The assessments themselves can be completed at any time and do not utilize a source such as Pearson Vue; they are completed right inside the MAD portal browser. You have unlimited attempts, but you can only take a specific assessment once per 24 hours. Assessments required between 70-80% correct answers and involved between 10 - 30 questions.

The assessments involved using ATT&CK Navigator and the ATT&CK site to answer questions, they did not rely on only memorization, like most certs seem to. You will get a good understanding of how to use ATT&CK, not just theory. 

Overall score: 85

Personally, I really enjoyed the fact that I got to use the ATT&CK Navigator and website during the assessments to answer questions, as if performing real world tasks. This really helps to see the impact ATT&CK can have. I thought the training was decent and enjoyable for the most part, I would have liked to see some things more than just slides, such as interactions with Navigator. You do get multiple certs for the price of one typical cert ($499) so it is not so steep. If you have no interest in ATT&CK, do not purchase these certs. If you would like to be certified or learn more, I would recommend doing some training on Cybrary then purchasing and taking the assessments.
